This project contains the source code for my personal website. I built the site using custom HTML, CSS, and JS code on top of the [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink) framework. The static files are hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and made available at [haydenmoritz.com](https://haydenmoritz.com/).
